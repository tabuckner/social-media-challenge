# Social Media Dashboard Challenge
A Frontend Challenge for potential candidates.
_Based on a FE Mentor Challenge_

## Overview
Your challenge is to build out this Social Media Dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Suggested Technologies
* Angular CLI
* Angular Component Library (i.e. Angular Material)

## Design Resources

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## API
There is a small [@nestjs](https://docs.nestjs.com/) API included with this challenge.

### Running the API
To start the API simple run the following in a terminal opened in the root of this repo:
```bash
cd api && npm install && npm start
```
_Note: You can sub `npm` for whatever comparable tool you use (e.g. `yarn` or `npx`).)_

### Swagger Docs
Swagger Docs provide a friendly web interface for exploring an API. Ours include information about the endpoints exposed for this project, and the models contained.

Once the API is running, you can visit the [Swagger Docs](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) in your browser at:
[http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api)

## How To Complete
1. Fork this Repo
2. Create your application in the root of this directory
3. Send your fork to me directly or via a Pull Request

### Example of Directory Structure
```bash
./
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ api
â””â”€â”€ my_app
    â””â”€â”€ src
        â””â”€â”€ app
```

## Requirements
While working on this project, try to keep Angular and Web Development best practices in mind as much as possible. An attempt was made to keep the application simple to leave room for this. Here's a list of a few concepts you might consider when working on the application: 
* How different types of modules might be used (Routed Modules, Feature Modules, etc)
* The differences in responsibilities of the core Angular constructs (Component Controllers, Component Templates, Services, Pipes, Directives, etc)
* Scoping of core Angular Constructs ('Where should this service be scoped?', 'Should this component be declared in my AppModule or in my FeatureModule?')
* Responsive Web Behaviors

## Bonus Points
### None of the Following Is Expected
#### Seriously...
##### No, I Mean It.
* Animations
  * List View Animations
  * Router Transitions
  * Micro Interactions
* Light/Dark Mode ('cause fashion ðŸ’…)
* Client-Side Sorting of Similarity Results
* ...âœ¨anything your heart desiresâœ¨...
